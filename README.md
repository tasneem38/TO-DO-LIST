# TO-DO-LIST
This project serves as both a practical productivity solution and a foundational example 
for web development learners. Its structure and logic are simple enough to be understood 
by beginners, yet the implementation demonstrates essential principles such as event
driven programming, DOM manipulation, and responsive design. The app is entirely 
browser-based, making it a lightweight, install-free, and offline-compatible task manager.
